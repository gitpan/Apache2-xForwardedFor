=head1 NAME

Apache2::xForwardedFor - Re-set remote_ip to incoming client's ip when running mod_perl behind a reverse proxy server. 
In other words, copy the first IP from B<X-Forwarded-For> header, which was set by your reverse proxy server, 
to the B<remote_ip> connection property.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  in httpd.conf

    PerlModule Apache2::xForwardedFor
	PerlSetVar  xForwardedForRequire 1
	PerlSetVar  xForwardedForAccept 192.168.1.1
	PerlAddVar  xForwardedForAccept 192.168.1.2
	PerlPostReadRequestHandler Apache2::xForwardedFor
	
  also note:
  	PerlSetVar  xForwardedForRequireHeaderName X-Internal-Password
	PerlSetVar  xForwardedForRequireHeaderValue shibby

  or:
    PerlSetVar  xForwardedForRequireHeaderName X-Forwarded-Server
	PerlSetVar  xForwardedForRequireHeaderValue lanServer1
	PerlAddVar  xForwardedForRequireHeaderValue lanServer2


=head1 USAGE

At this time you simply need to load the module and add it to the PerlPostReadRequestHandler phase of your mod_perl-enabled httpd, and set a few variables.

Apache2::xForwardedFor is really flexible and does some very odd things 

=head1 VARIABLES

=head2 xForwardedForAlternateHeaderName
should you want to receive the X-Forwarded-For info from the proxy server on another ip, the name of it would be the value of this variable.

=head2 xForwardedForRequire
require the X-Forwarded-For header (or alternate name).  return FORBIDDEN otherwise

Why would you do this?  So that by default you can use either access apache through the proxy or directly.  This is FALSE by default, if someone wants to patch to be TRUE by default, send it my way. 

=head2 xForwardedForRequireHeaderName
should you require an additional header, this is the name of it.

Why would you do this?  Maybe you don't trust your gateway/proxy admin to be filtering headers correctly.  So you want to put a hash or an internal lan marking on internal requests.

=head2 xForwardedForRequireHeaderValue
should you require an additional header (xForwardedForRequireHeaderName), this is the value.  this will be ignored if xForwardedForRequireHeaderName is not set.  if xForwardedForRequireHeader and this is UNDEF, the header value does not match, or the header is not sent, this will return FORBIDDEN


head2= xForwardedForAccept 
single item or list of IP addresses to accept

head3= xForwardedForDeny
single item or list of IP addresses to deny

=head1 BUGS/TODO

This doesn't support AT ALL: 
	IPV6
	X-Forwarded-Host

This doesn't fully support :
	X-Forwarded-Server

If you patch it to support those , let me know.

As illustrated in the example above, you can feign some support for X-Forwarded-Server by using the alternate header name
